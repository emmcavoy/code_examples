Welcome to my repository of coding examples. Uploaded here is code from three projects, each in a different programming language of Python, R, or Stata.

1. WorldBankData.py
   
	  Python script that downloads data from the World Bankâ€™s website and transforms the data into a single CSV file for longitudinal analysis with country-year as unit of analysis. 

2. VoterSurvey.R and VoterSurvey.nb.html
   
	  R script and notebook that analyzes voting behavior in the U.S. 2016 presidential election using data from the VOTER (Views of the Electorate Research) Survey. This is a small subset of the analysis conducted for my semester project for CSCI-B 365 Introduction to Data Analysis and Mining. The full paper is also available in the repository, named CSCI_B_365_Final.pdf. 

3. ProcessPhysicianCompare.do
   
	  Stata script that takes yearly Physician Compare data zip files and creates a cleaned data file with all the years' data for 2020-2022.
